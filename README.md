"# Traffic-detections" 



This code is a Python implementation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for traffic sign detection. The model is trained on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset, which contains 43 classes of traffic signs. The code loads the dataset, preprocesses it, and splits it into training, validation, and testing sets.

The CNN model consists of several layers of convolutional and pooling layers followed by a few fully connected layers. The model uses rectified linear units (ReLU) as the activation function for the convolutional layers and softmax activation for the output layer. The model is compiled with categorical cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer.

The model is trained for a fixed number of epochs and evaluated on the testing set. Finally, the model predicts the class of traffic signs using the testing set.
